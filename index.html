          <h3>Hello, my name is Sharmistha!</h3>
          <p>I'm currently a senior studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. After taking software engineering courses, I became interested in the concept of human centered computing and how we can use computer science to create systems that support human activities.</p>
          <p>I started learning front end development on my own through online courses, and here you can find a few of my projects. I hope to learn more about user design and user experience in the future, and bring the concepts of human centered computing to education to help improve the technology that assists students in their educational experience.</p>

                          <p class="modalDes">For a school assignment, I created a web blog that allowed users to sign in and add their own post. Using Google App Engine, I incorporated the ability for users to sign in with their google account, and saved their posts with Objectify and Datastore. I used basic HTML and CSS for the design, and deployed the website onto Google App Engine using Eclipse.</p>
                          <p class="modalDes">The theme of the blog followed travel posts, where users could share their experiences during their adventures. If they are not signed in with their google account, they can only read posts. The home page of the blog only shows the three latest posts, but a link on the bottom directs the user to another page to view all posts on the blog.</p>
                          <p class="modalDes"> If the user chooses to add a post, the site directs them to sign in. Once signed in, the bottom of the page will include a text-input box for them to add a post. In addition to reading and adding posts, the user can also choose to subscribe to the blog, where they can receive a daily email containing the latest activity on the blog.</p>

                          <p class="modalDes">For a semester long group project, my team created an android app for our University's SureWalk Program, which allows students to request volunteers to safely walk them home late at night. Our app was designed for two types of users, students who were requesting to be walked home and volunteers who were accepting walk requests. My team spent the beginning of the semester creating mockups for the app, designing use case and class diagrams, and incorporating design patterns to organize how our code would be written.</p>

                          <p class="modalDes">Using Android Studio, we worked together to build each page of the app. We incorporated Google Maps API to allow the app to obtain the locations that students would be walking to. Since users can login and create new acounts, we saved user information and location data using Firebase API. After creating the application, we tested different user scenarios using Junit test cases.</p>

                        <p class="modalDes">Engineers for a Sustainable World (<a href="https://www.eswusa.org/">ESW</a>) is a non-profit organization comprised of students, university faculty, and professionals who are dedicated to building a more sustainable world through various technical projects and outreach activities. Each year they hold a conference to bring together chapters from around the world. This year, the conference will be held in Austin TX and will consist of various events and keynote speakers. As a new feature, ESW hopes to include a mobile app that will allow attendees to stay organized and informed during the conference.</p>
                        <p class="modalDes">As a member of the ESW chapter at The University of Texas in Austin, I have taken on the task to design and build this app for the conference to use. Because the event will be held in April 2017, the following descriptions and images will show my plan and current progress of the app.</p>
                        <p class="modalDes">After sitting down with members of ESW headquarters, the following requirements were decided:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Users should see the schedule for the conference</li>
                            <li>Users should see the different options for speakers to attend during each session</li>
                            <li>Users should have access to a map of the area</li>
                            <li>Users can view suggested activities and food for the Austin area</li>
                            <li>The app should be available for both android and iOS</li>
                          </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p class="modalDes">From these requirements, I created a preliminary design of the app that include four main pages: About Austin, Schedule, Sessions, and Map</p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="modalDes">Since the app needed to be available for both android and iOS, I decided it would be easier if I could develop using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. <a href="https://buildfire.com/developers/">Buildfire</a>, a platform for building mobile apps, allows developers to build customized plugins and pages using web technologies, while they take care of sending the app to Apple and Google Play. This will allow me to concentrate on the user design and functionality of the app, while Buildfire can verify that our app will be properly published.</p>
                        <p class="modalDes">Below are images of the schedule page of the app where users can view the events of the conference, and click each event to read more information. Everything below the Schedule header is developed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, while the header and menu is part of Buildfire's platform.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="modalDes">Buildfire also includes a database to store user information and a global positioning system, that can be incorporated to improve our app's functionality with additional features. Future work will include devloping the remaining pages of the app and if time allows, using the datastore to allow the user to save events to their own schedule and using the GPS to give user's directions to specific events.</p>
